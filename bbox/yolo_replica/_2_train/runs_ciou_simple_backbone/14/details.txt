Bounding Box Training Run
-------------------------
Satellite:       cassini
Sequence:       1
Distance:       close
Batch size:      64
Max epochs:      500
Learning rate:   0.0003
Device:          x2 GPUs
Notes:           Single-class (satellite), event-only input
Notes: Retraining with changes for giving more importance to prob_obj and prob_cls (ensure they don't go to 0)
Notes: set obj bias in model to 10.0 + lambda_obj = 150 + focal loss with gamma=4.0
Results: .....
