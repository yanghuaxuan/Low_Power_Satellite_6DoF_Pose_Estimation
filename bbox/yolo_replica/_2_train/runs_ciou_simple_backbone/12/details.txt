Bounding Box Training Run
-------------------------
Satellite:       cassini
Sequence:       1
Distance:       close
Batch size:      64
Max epochs:      500
Learning rate:   0.0003
Device:          x2 GPUs
Notes:           Single-class (satellite), event-only input
Notes: Retraining with changes for giving more importance to prob_obj and prob_cls (ensure they don't go to 0)
Notes: Notes: total_loss = 10 * box_loss (CIoU) + 20* p_obj_loss (Focal Loss) + 10 * p_class_loss (Focal Loss)
Notes: Notes: Added bias in model for obj_conf & class_prob → start with higher logit (~0.5–0.9 prob)
Notes: obj_conf & class_prob losses with gradual distance to bbox center/edges
Notes: increase sigma to 1.2
Results: .....
