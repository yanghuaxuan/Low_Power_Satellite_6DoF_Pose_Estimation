Bounding Box Training Run
-------------------------
Satellite:       cassini
Sequence:       1
Distance:       close
Batch size:      64
Max epochs:      500
Learning rate:   0.0005
Device:          x2 GPUs
Notes:           Single-class (satellite), event-only input
Notes: Notes: total_loss = 20 * box_loss (CIoU) + 1 * p_obj_loss (BCE) + 0.5 * p_class_loss (BCE)
Notes: patience 60 + max epochs 500 (keep it high for convergence)
longer training: min_delta_pct from 0.005 (0.5%) to 0.0005 (0.05%)
increase weight decay: from 1e-5 to 3e-5
Results: 170 epochs: train_loss_box=0.33 val_loss_box=0.3 (BETTER THAN PREVIOUS)
