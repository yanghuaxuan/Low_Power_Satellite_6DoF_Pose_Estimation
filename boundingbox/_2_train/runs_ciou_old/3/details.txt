Bounding Box Training Run
-------------------------
Satellite:       cassini
Sequence:       1
Distance:       close
Batch size:      64
Max epochs:      500
Learning rate:   0.001
Device:          x2 GPUs
Notes:           Single-class (satellite), event-only input
Notes: Notes: total_loss = 10 * box_loss (CIoU) + 1 * p_obj_loss (BCE) + 0.5 * p_class_loss (BCE)
Notes: higher LR: 1e-3 (back to original)
Notes: patience 60 + max epochs 500 (keep it high for convergence)
Results: 0.35 training box loss, and around 0.4 val box loss (aprox) - epoch 99 early stop
