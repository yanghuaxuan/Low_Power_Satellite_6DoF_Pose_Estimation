Bounding Box Training Run
-------------------------
Satellite:       cassini
Sequence:       1
Distance:       close
Batch size:      64
Max epochs:      500
Learning rate:   0.0001
Device:          x2 GPUs
Notes:           Single-class (satellite), event-only input
Notes: Notes: total_loss = 30 * box_loss (CIoU) + 1 * p_obj_loss (BCE) + 0.5 * p_class_loss (BCE)
Notes: patience 100 + max epochs 500 (keep it high for convergence)
longer training: min_delta_pct 0.00005 (0.005%)
increase weight decay to 6e-5
Results: worse than previous: val_box_loss = 0.35, train_loss_box = 0.34
